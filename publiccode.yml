    longDescription: |- 
      VVFGeoFleet is a system allowing to track a fleet, where 
      vehicles are equipped with GPS enabled devices periodically 
      sending their position. The system is composed of two main 
      modules: (i) a backend module, based on a RESTful server; (ii) a 
      frontend module, based on an Angular GUI. The backend is written 
      in C# Asp.Net WebApi, using Visual Studio 2017 Community 
      Edition, with a persistence layer based on MongoDB document 
      database. It collects position messages coming from GPS enabled 
      devices installed on board the vehicles; publishes REST actions 
      to efficiently query the collected data. Queries allow, for 
      instance, to: (i) getting the current fleet position (also by 
      vehicle class); (ii) getting a vehicle position; (iii) getting a 
      vehicle tracked path, within a given time interval; (iv) getting 
      vehicles near to a given point (also by vehicle class); (v) 
      getting vehicles within a given rectangle; (vi) getting vehicles 
      inactive since too much time. The backend is optimized to 
      collect data and hold them forever, without the need for purging 
      old data periodically. The RESTful API leverages the MongoDB 
      database and its spatial features. All database queries are 
      carefully optimized to exploit indexes; thus, the response time 
      is extremely low even in case of millions messages stored. 
      The RESTful API enables the frontend to graphically display 
      data, but it is especially conceived to be queried by other 
      applications (B2B) in order to act as a decision support system 
      (DSS). The frontend is based on Angular6 and uses Google maps 
      javascript API to show information. Currently the source code 
      and the RESTful interface is a mix of English and Italian words. 
      During the implementation, the Italian words will be translated 
      as much as possible. VVFGeoFleet can receive keep-alive messages 
      (e.g. every minute or so) from vehicles, in order to promptly 
      know whether a vehicle is out-of-field or the GPS device is 
      faulty. In presence of many vehicles (i.e. more than 10.000) 
      those messages might be heavy to be stored. To cope with this 
      issue, VVFGeoFleet holds only messages carrying position deltas, 
      while interpolating messages received by the same vehicle in the 
      same position. Interpolation information is saved together with 
      the interpolating messages, so to prevent such inforation to get 
      lost. On each position message reception, VVFGeoFleet computes 
      the vehicle velocity comparing the received message with the 
      latest stored one. In case such velocity exceeds a given 
      threshold, a warning is traced in the application log (based on 
      log4net). Too high velocities might be due to bad GPS device 
      configuration of faulty GPS device. The system publishes 
      statistics about message arrival per day, total number of stored 
      messages, messages arrival rate, etc. Statistics can be read to 
      check correct system operation, and can be processed through 
      automated systems in order to raise alarms in case of anomalous 
      indicators. Posting position messages can be subject to client 
      authorization, based on IP source address. The web.config allows 
      to enable/disable IP-based authorization through a flag and to 
      specify the list of allowed IP and/or networks (e.g. 127.0.0.1, 
      8.8.8.8, 10.0.0.0/24, 172.16.0.0/16).
